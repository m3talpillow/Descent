**Formating:**  
File names start with a capital and are cammel case. Files do not need their function at the end of the name, ie: InputScript because it is a script. As long as the files are in the correct directory it is understood that is what they are.  
Variable names should be explict (longer and detailed over short and vague) and be cammel case. If a variable can only be used by another component in the script then start the var name with a shortened version of the component followed by an underscore and variable name. ie: var Animator anim and var int anim_vertical can only be used by the anim component.  
Fields declared at top of class should be grouped by similarity with a comment above the group stating its purpose or use.  
Methods names should be descriptive and cammel case with first letter being capitalized. Opening bracket should be placed on the line below method name.
